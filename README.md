# Antonio Sánchez Pacheco
**Backend Developer · Technical Project Lead**

Backend developer focused on building **scalable, maintainable backend systems** with clean architecture and strong foundations.  
I have led and developed web and mobile platforms for hundreds of users, integrating APIs, payment systems, and cloud deployments.

My core focus is backend development using **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma**, while leveraging frontend experience with **Nuxt.js and Vue** to make better architectural decisions and collaborate efficiently across teams.

I am currently working extensively with **Express.js and JavaScript**, emphasizing **application modularization**, clean code, and best practices to ensure long-term scalability and maintainability.  
I am highly interested in microservices-oriented architectures and continuously exploring their practical adoption.
